# Shortest-Path-Problem
# Graph-Based Shortest Path Problem 

This Java program reads city distance data from a CSV file, represents it as a graph, and finds the shortest path between cities using BFS & DFS algorithms. It also implements custom Stack & Queue structures for optimized performance.

Features:
	•	Parses CSV data into a 2D array
	•	Represents cities and connections as a graph
	•	Implements BFS (Breadth-First Search) & DFS (Depth-First Search) for pathfinding
	•	Uses custom Stack & Queue instead of built-in Java structures

Usage:
	1.	Load a CSV file with city distances
	2.	Choose a starting and ending city
	3.	The program calculates the shortest path.
